As we can see, all the datatimes are different in each pod

2. Describe and explain in the report the differences between the output of the command for
replicas.
- To not slow the application we don't want to read/write the same file for each pod,
so we use StatefulSet, so each pod has its own file with data

3. Ordering guarantee are unnecessary
- I don't actually think that it is necessary for our application, because each pod is independent

4. Then find a way to tell to
the StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel.
- We can use: podManagementPolicy: "Parallel" for StatefulSet spec
I implemented it in my chart
